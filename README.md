# r_lidar_hacks
This repository contains a bunch of R scripts for manipulating LiDAR data.
1. merge_las.R is a script that will merge multiple las/laz files using the lasmerge.exe from LasTools.
2. bounding_box.R is a script that allows you to create a rectangular polygon and clip the las object to it.
